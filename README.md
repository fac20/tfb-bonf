<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->

The project can be accessed through this link: https://opportutoring-platform.web.app/.
We have currently only enabled sign-ins as we only want admins to be allowed to create a new user.
To explore the platform, sign in with the details below:
username: hello@me.com
password: 123456

As of 23/10/2020, the login page and logging in capabilities are finished. However, the home page, and resources page are still blank.
The add lesson form has been created and does add the lesson into our database, which can be viewed through the firebase console.
We have hard-corded several values for testing purposes currently, however, they will be changed after we have set some other aspects up.

### Known Bugs
- you can still see the login page for a split second once it refreshes and you are already logged in, before transferring you to the home page
